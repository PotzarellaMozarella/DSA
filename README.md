# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Practice repository! Here, you will find a collection of practice questions covering a wide range of topics, including Arrays, Graphs, Trees, Linked Lists, Matrices, Numbers, Sorting, Stacks & Queues, and Strings. These questions are designed to help you sharpen your problem-solving skills and gain proficiency in data structures and algorithms.

## How to Use This Repository

### Directory Structure

The repository is organized into different folders, each dedicated to a specific topic or data structure. You will find the following directories:

- `Numbers`: Problems related to numerical algorithms and mathematics.
- `Strings`: String manipulation, searching, and algorithms.
- `Arrays`: Practice questions related to array manipulation and algorithms.
- `Matrix`: Matrix manipulation and traversal problems.
- `Sorting`: Sorting algorithms and related practice questions.
- `Stacks & Queues`: Questions involving stacks and queues.
- `LinkedLists`: Questions about linked lists, both singly and doubly linked.
- `Graphs`: Questions related to graph traversal, shortest paths, and more.
- `Trees`: Problems concerning binary trees, binary search trees, and other tree-related concepts.


### Contribution Guidelines

- Feel free to add your own practice questions to any of the directories. Ensure that you provide clear problem statements and example inputs/outputs.
- If you spot an issue with an existing question or have a better solution, please open an issue or create a pull request.
- Use meaningful file names for your questions, such as `ReverseArray.java` or `BFSTraversal.py`, to make it easier for others to find and understand your code.
